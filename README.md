# stock-analysis
Performing stock analysis on DQ if a sound investment
Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Can a Visual Basic Macro be refactored for increased efficiency?
    - This stock analysis through VBA provides a snapshot of performance across 12 stocks during 2017 and 2018 to make an informative decision  of a sound long term investment.
    - First a code was created to run a value analysis on DQ stock
    - Next the code was reused, now focusing on All Stocks
    - Then a code initialized an index to loop through 12 tickers
		- Within this loop, ticker starting and ending prices were assigned based off of the Ticker Index
    - Finally, the anaylsis runs evaluating performance across the stock array for 2017 & 2018
