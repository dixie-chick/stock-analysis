## VBA Stock Analysis
This stock analysis using Excel's VBA function provides a performance snapshot for 2017 and 2018 across 12 tickers to make an informative decision on a hold ivestment strategy.

- First, a code was created to run specifically on DQ ticker performance
- Next the code was reused to focus on All Stocks in the index
- Then, a code initialized the index to loop through all 12 tickers
  - Within this loop, ticker starting and ending prices were assigned based off the Ticker Index
- Finally, the analysis runs evaluating performance across the stock array for 2017 and 2018


## Can a Visual Basic Macro be refactored for increased efficiency?

Lets take a look at the output from the original code created:

Now lets compare this to the run time after refactoring:
